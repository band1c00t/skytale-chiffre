# Skytale Cipher â€“ Python Implementation

A simple Python project that implements the ancient **Skytale cipher** for encryption and decryption.

### What is the Skytale cipher?
The Skytale (or Scytale) cipher is one of the oldest transposition ciphers, used by the Spartans. A message is written on a strip wound around a rod and read vertically to produce a scrambled text.

### Features
- Encrypt plaintext using a key (rod width)
- Decrypt ciphertext using the same key
- Interactive console input

### How to Use

```bash
# Run the script
python skytale.py
```
